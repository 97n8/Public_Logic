  <h3>Year 1: Partnership Sprint + Foundation</h3>
  <div class="price-highlight" style="font-size:42px">$0</div>
  <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:600;color:#0b2530;margin:8px 0"><strong>First year is free. Zero cost to Sutton.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>What you get at no charge:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>90-day implementation sprint with weekly check-ins</li>
    <li>PRR + DPW + 2 additional workflow modules (Sutton chooses during sprint)</li>
    <li>GIS integration, SSO/identity, email/SMS notifications</li>

    <strong>Why free?</strong> We're a new company proving a model. Sutton's partnership, feedback, and willingness to be a reference case study is the value exchange. If this works for Sutton, we both win. If it doesn't, you've lost nothing but time—and we've learned what needs fixing.
  </div>
  <p style="background:#fff3cd;padding:12px;border-radius:6px;margin-top:16px"><strong>What happens after Year 1:</strong> If SuttonCONNECT delivers value, we discuss Year 2+ pricing based on a per-resident model. Pricing will be determined once CLERK and FIX modules are implemented, creating a clear path forward that scales with demonstrated value. If it doesn't work, you owe nothing and keep everything we built. No strings, no surprises.</p>

    <h3>Years 2+: Per-Resident Pricing Model</h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:600;color:#0b2530;margin:8px 0">$___ to $___ per resident/year</p>
    <p><strong>Final pricing determined after CLERK and FIX modules are implemented, based on what Sutton actually needs and decides to use.</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:12px">Pricing reflects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modules implemented:</strong> Only pay for what you deploy (PRR, DPW, CLERK, FIX, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>AI level chosen:</strong> Base tier included; Plus/Pro upgrades optional if they fit your workflow</li>
      <li><strong>Town size:</strong> Per-resident model scales fairly—small towns pay less</li>
      <li><strong>How you work:</strong> Built around Sutton's pace and processes, not vendor assumptions</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="pull" style="font-size:14px;margin-top:12px">This isn't about pushing the most expensive package. It's about what works for the way Sutton wants to work now and in the future. Your final cost reflects your choices during Year 1—not our sales targets.</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why the Time to Modernize is Now</h3>
    <p><strong>Sutton hasn't made major technology investments recently—and that's actually an advantage.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No technical debt:</strong> You're not locked into expensive legacy systems that don't talk to each other</li>
      <li><strong>Clean slate approach:</strong> Build what Sutton needs today, not what vendors sold you five years ago</li>
      <li><strong>Federal/state funding cycles align:</strong> Digital equity and infrastructure grants are available now</li>
      <li><strong>Staff expectations are changing:</strong> Modern tools attract and retain talent in competitive hiring markets</li>
      <li><strong>Succession window is open:</strong> Preserve institutional knowledge before key staff transitions happen</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="pull" style="font-size:14px;margin-top:12px">Towns that waited to modernize often regret the delay—not because technology changed, but because the institutional knowledge walked out the door first. The best time to preserve what you know is before you need it.</div>
    <div class="note" style="margin-top:12px"><strong>No major infrastructure investments required.</strong> SuttonCONNECT is cloud-based and integrates with what you already have (Google Workspace, email, GIS). The investment is in process improvement, not servers and licenses.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card" style="margin-top:20px;background:#f0f9ff;border:2px solid #0ea5a4">
  <h3 style="margin-top:0">The Path Forward</h3>
  <div style="display:grid;gap:12px;margin-top:12px">
    <div style="padding:12px;background:#fff;border-radius:8px;border-left:4px solid #0e7a72">
      <strong>Year 1 (Free):</strong> Implement PRR, DPW, and 2 additional modules Sutton chooses. Prove the foundation works with zero financial risk.
    </div>
    <div style="padding:12px;background:#fff;border-radius:8px;border-left:4px solid #0ea5a4">
      <strong>During Year 1:</strong> Add CLERK and FIX modules to demonstrate full platform capabilities. Sutton decides what to keep, what to expand, what to defer.
    </div>
    <div style="padding:12px;background:#fff;border-radius:8px;border-left:4px solid #0f766e">
      <strong>Year 2+ Pricing Decision:</strong> Per-resident pricing based on (1) modules Sutton implements, (2) AI level that fits your workflow (Base/Plus/Pro), (3) demonstrated value. Built around how Sutton wants to work—not our roadmap.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="note" style="margin-top:16px"><strong>Plus:</strong> If one grant application succeeds during Year 1 (typical MassWorks or Community Compact awards: $50K–$150K), future years could be entirely grant-funded. You've essentially been paid to modernize.</p>
  <p class="note" style="margin-top:12px;padding:12px;background:#fff3cd;border-radius:6px;border:1px solid #e5c100"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Year 1 costs you nothing. No major infrastructure investments needed. Per-resident pricing in Years 2+ will be determined based on what you actually implement and use—not what we think you need. If it doesn't work, you've lost nothing but some time, and you keep everything we built. This is the lowest-risk decision you'll make this year.</p>
