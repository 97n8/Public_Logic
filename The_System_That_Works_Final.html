      Editor’s note: The accompanying illustration depicts a classic town hall standing firm above ground, the American flag waving, while below, unseen workers strain to hold everything together.

  <p>Public institutions appear stable from the outside. But beneath many of them, invisible work holds everything together.</p>
  <p>The building stands. We do not thank the mason who set the hidden lintel. We admire the façade and assume it will remain upright.</p>
  <p>The same instinct applies to public administration. Permits get issued. Calls get returned. Payments clear. Meetings convene and adjourn. The public sees the checkmark and moves on.</p>
  <p>From the outside, it all looks fine.</p>
  <p>That is not an accident. Most public systems are designed to look stable. They are built to deliver outcomes, not to display the strain required to produce them. When something does not quite fit the rules, the system rarely announces the problem. It pauses. Then someone, often unnamed, quietly steps in.</p>
  <p>Across towns, cities, schools, courts, and agencies, work routinely continues beyond formal authority. Decisions get nudged forward without clear ownership. Exceptions get handled without records. Gaps get bridged quietly so the public never experiences a delay.</p>
  <p>We describe this as dedication. Or professionalism. Or institutional knowledge.</p>
  <p>Those descriptions are flattering. They are also incomplete.</p>
  <p>What is really happening is risk relocation. When authority stops moving but work does not, risk does not disappear. It moves downward. It settles into people. It lives in memory, judgment, favors, side emails, sticky notes, and late nights. The system appears to function, but only because individuals absorb what the structure does not hold.</p>
  <p>Most of the time, this goes unnoticed. That is the point.</p>
  <p>We celebrate automation, modernization, and efficiency. We admire clean interfaces and smooth workflows. But beneath many of these systems is a quieter reality: unrecorded work propping them up, human hands carrying weight they were never formally authorized to bear.</p>
  <p>So the workaround becomes the norm. The exception becomes the process. Approval is implied rather than named. And because the system continues to deliver, everyone learns the wrong lesson.</p>
  <p>The lesson is not that the system is sound. The lesson is that it can rely on invisible labor indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Until it cannot.</p>
  <p>Turnover exposes this fragility. Retirement. Illness. Burnout. A single departure can suddenly reveal how much of the system was being held together by people whose names never appeared on an org chart or a decision log.</p>
  <p>When that happens, the reaction is often confusion. How did this break? Why did no one see it? Who was responsible?</p>
  <p>The uncomfortable answer is that the system was never fully holding the work in the first place.</p>
  <p>This is not a critique of public servants. It is a recognition of what they routinely compensate for.</p>
  <p>But that protection comes at a cost.</p>
  <p>When risk lives in people instead of structure, it becomes fragile. It becomes nontransferable. It becomes dependent on trust rather than clarity. And trust, while essential, is not a governance strategy.</p>
  <p>A system that functions only as long as certain people do not move is not resilient. It is borrowed time.</p>
  <p>The illustration accompanying this piece does not show a scandal or a collapse. It shows something far more common: a system that works exactly as designed on the surface and exactly as improvised underneath.</p>
  <p>That condition exists in more places than we are comfortable admitting. Once you see it, you recognize it everywhere.</p>
  <p>The question is not whether the work will continue. It always does.</p>
  <p>The question is where the weight is being held, by whom, and what happens when those hands let go.</p>
