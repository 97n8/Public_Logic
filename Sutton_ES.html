    <h1>VAULT for Sutton – Executive Modernization Brief</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">A practical, modern, and sustainable framework for municipal operations</div>
    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>1. The challenge Sutton is facing</h2>
    <p>Sutton operates at the level of a modern city while staffed like a small Massachusetts town. You maintain a strong bond rating and a multi million dollar budget while navigating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Staff at or near capacity</li>
      <li>Increasing state and federal compliance requirements</li>
      <li>Grants that require detailed documentation</li>
      <li>Residents who expect online services and transparency</li>
      <li>Institutional knowledge that lives in long serving staff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Across the Commonwealth this combination often results in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Burnout and turnover</li>
      <li>Compliance exposure</li>
      <li>Longer service times and resident frustration</li>
      <li>Scrambles to reconstruct documentation for audits, grants, and public records requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many critical workflows rely on <strong>manual routines and institutional memory</strong> rather than durable systems. You do not need another vendor to tell you that your team is busy. The real question is whether some of this work can be made simpler, more predictable, and easier to support with the tools you already own.</p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>2. What VAULT is, in plain terms</h2>
    <p><strong>VAULT, Verified Automation and Unified Logic for Towns,</strong> is a municipal first framework that standardizes routines, documentation, and compliance across departments.</p>

    <p>VAULT is <strong>not a new software system</strong>. It runs inside the tools Sutton already uses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Workspace</li>
      <li>CivicPlus and CivicCMS</li>
      <li>Munis</li>
      <li>Existing departmental tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>PublicLogic designs the workflows and compliance logic. <strong>Polimorphic</strong> provides a lightweight automation layer for intake, routing, approvals, and task management that integrates with your existing systems instead of replacing them. The goal is straightforward. Use clear, repeatable workflows to reduce manual steps and make compliance easier to prove.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Concrete example</strong>
      <p>In a comparable Massachusetts community the same framework reduced routine posting work and helped build repeatable workflows that continued to function during staff transitions. The model is designed to keep working even as personnel change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>3. Why this matters now for Sutton</h2>
    <p>Sutton is in a constructive window:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Institutional knowledge is still intact</li>
      <li>Staff capacity is stretched but functioning</li>
      <li>Your technology stack is solid but not unified</li>
      <li>Several state grants can help offset modernization costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best time to build durable workflows is <strong>before</strong> key retirements or turnover. Rebuilding after people leave is significantly harder and more expensive. This brief is intended as a starting point before any discovery work, so you can see what a structured approach might look like without any commitments.</p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>4. The four pressure points</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Pressure point</th>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <th>Risk</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Capacity</td>
        <td>Staff at or near maximum</td>
        <td>Burnout and service delays</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Compliance</td>
        <td>Manual tracking and paper trails</td>
        <td>Audit findings or missed deadlines</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Knowledge transfer</td>
        <td>Critical knowledge is informal</td>
        <td>Loss of institutional memory when staff leave</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Service expectations</td>
        <td>Residents expect tracking and updates</td>
        <td>Frustration and reputational risk</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>5. How VAULT works – two applied scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Public Works – VAULT FIX and ServiceTrack</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Residents submit requests online or staff enter them during calls or walk ins</li>
      <li>Requests route automatically by type, location, and priority</li>
      <li>The superintendent views all new and open items in one place</li>
      <li>Crew update status in the field from a mobile friendly view</li>
      <li>Labor can be captured through VAULT TIMETRACK</li>
      <li>Capital conditions can feed into VAULT CIP for planning</li>
      <li>Residents receive automatic status updates without extra staff steps</li>
      <li>Documentation builds as work is completed rather than after the fact</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clerk’s Office – VAULT CLERK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Meeting Law postings follow one predictable workflow</li>
      <li>Agendas and minutes move through a standard intake path</li>
      <li>Retention rules are built into workflow decisions</li>
      <li>Staff receive reminders and checklists automatically</li>
      <li>Records store in a consistent, audit ready structure</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>6. VAULT modules by municipal function</h2>

    <h3>Governance and Clerk operations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VAULT CORE</strong> – Unified logic, retention, and compliance rules</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT CLERK</strong> – Open Meeting Law postings, agendas, minutes, meeting support</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT AP</strong> – Approvals, routing, and signatures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Public Works and service delivery</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VAULT FIX</strong> – Infrastructure requests and work orders</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT SERVICETRACK</strong> – Assignment and field updates</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT TIMETRACK</strong> – Labor and payroll support, grant aligned documentation</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT CONNECT</strong> – Resident intake, tracking, and notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Finance and capital</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VAULT FISCAL</strong> – Budget operations and transparency support</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT CIP</strong> – Asset tracking, scoring, and multi year planning</li>
      <li><strong>VAULT APFLOW</strong> – Accounts payable workflow and documentation support</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Extensible modules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VAULT HR</strong></li>
      <li><strong>VAULT MS4</strong></li>
      <li><strong>VAULT RECORDS</strong></li>
      <li>Department specific routines built on VAULT CORE</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>7. Behavioral systems – why adoption succeeds</h2>
    <p>Technology alone does not fix municipal problems. Adoption depends on behavior, capacity, and trust.</p>

    <p><strong>PublicInsight</strong>, led by <strong>Dr. Allison Weiss Rothschild</strong>, focuses on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive load and staff bandwidth for change</li>
      <li>How people respond under deadline pressure</li>
      <li>Training methods that match adult learning</li>
      <li>Resistance patterns and realistic pacing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Workflows are designed for how municipal staff actually work, not an idealized model of how they should work. The intent is to build systems that staff will use on a busy Tuesday afternoon, not only on a perfect day.</p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>8. Implementation and Year One at no cost</h2>
    <p><strong>Year One includes, at no cost to Sutton:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovery and readiness assessment, including behavioral readiness</li>
      <li>Implementation of one VAULT module, often VAULT FIX or VAULT CLERK to start</li>
      <li>Training and plain language documentation</li>
      <li>Support for implemented workflows for the full year</li>
      <li>Quarterly reviews and adjustments</li>
      <li>Grant support discussions for Years Two and Three</li>
      <li>Full ownership of the workflows in Sutton’s environment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phased approach</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Discovery and readiness, four to six weeks:</strong> Map workflows, assess capacity, and select a starting module.</li>
      <li><strong>Foundation build, eight to twelve weeks:</strong> Implement the first module with PublicLogic and Polimorphic and establish early wins.</li>
      <li><strong>Expansion, ongoing:</strong> Add modules based on priorities, capacity, and funding.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>9. Investment structure and expected cost range</h2>
    <p><strong>Discovery phase:</strong> No cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Year One implementation and support:</strong> No cost. The full first year is covered as part of a pilot so Sutton can evaluate the impact in real conditions without financial risk.</p>

    <h3>Expected cost in Years Two and Three</h3>
    <p>If Sutton continues after the pilot year, similar towns typically fall within these ranges depending on the modules adopted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single module, for example CLERK or FIX:</strong> $12,000 to $18,000 annually</li>
      <li><strong>Two to three modules, for example CLERK, FIX, TIMETRACK:</strong> $18,000 to $32,000 annually</li>
      <li><strong>Broader operational suite:</strong> $32,000 to $48,000 annually</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These ranges include workflow updates, staff training, quarterly optimization, documentation support, and integration work for the modules in scope.</p>

    <p>Final pricing would be developed collaboratively with Sutton based on the modules selected, the level of support preferred, and any grant funding that can be applied.</p>

    <p>If Sutton does not continue after Year One there are no obligations or penalties. All workflows remain functional in Sutton’s environment and can be maintained internally or with regional IT support.</p>

    <div class="rule"></div>

    <h2>10. Next step</h2>
    <p>If this direction aligns with Sutton’s priorities, the next step is a 60-90 minute discovery meeting to walk through current workflows, capacity, and readiness. That conversation will shape a specific, realistic implementation path that fits Sutton’s needs.</p>
