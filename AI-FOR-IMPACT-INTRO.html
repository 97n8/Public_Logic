  <h2>What Municipal Teams Experience Every Day</h2>
  <p>
    Work in a town hall rarely arrives as a clearly defined project. It arrives as interruptions.
    An email that might be a public records request. A phone call that suddenly creates a deadline.
    A walk-in that becomes an obligation. A forwarded message with "FYI" and no clear next step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Staff are then expected to determine what the work actually is, who is responsible for it,
    what rules apply, what timelines matter, and how to bring it to closure. All of this happens while managing everything else.
  </p>
  <div class="example-box">
    <strong>Example</strong>
    A resident calls about a tree near their property line. The call gets routed to DPW, who determines
    it's on private property. But the resident mentioned the tree "might be diseased and could fall on the road."
    Now it's potentially a public safety issue—does that trigger an inspection obligation? Who's responsible
    for documenting that the town was notified? If the tree falls six months later, what's the record?
    Currently, this lives in someone's memory or a forwarded email chain.
  </div>
  <p>
    The issue isn't the tree. It's that nobody knows what the call activated—or whether it activated anything at all.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>The result:</strong> important obligations often live in inboxes, personal notes, or memory.
    Follow-through depends on individual judgment and availability rather than shared structure.
    When someone is out, leaves, or becomes overloaded, work can stall or reappear later under pressure.
  </div>
  <p>
    This is not a staffing problem. It is a <strong>structure problem</strong>.
    The work is real. The pressure is real. What is missing is a system designed to hold it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="page-break-before">How the Pilot Works</h2>
  <p>
    AI for Impact is a no-cost pilot delivered jointly by PublicLogic and Polimorphic.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>PublicLogic leads the initial review</strong>, working with staff to understand current workflows,
    how work enters the organization, where handoffs occur, and where things tend to become unclear or
    difficult to track. This step is practical and collaborative. It focuses on listening, mapping what
    exists today, and identifying opportunities to make day-to-day work easier to manage and easier to sustain.
  </p>
  <p>
    PublicLogic's work is included as part of the overall Polimorphic package. It happens first and helps
    ensure that any technology work is grounded in how the town actually operates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Polimorphic supports implementation only after this structure is in place, translating agreed-upon
    workflows into well-defined, supported systems.
  </p>

  <h3>A Note on AI</h3>
  <p>
    This pilot uses AI tools carefully and transparently. Any automation is implemented only after
    human governance structures are clear—staff will always know what's automated, what remains human judgment, and how to
    override automated steps when circumstances require it. AI supports the work; it does not replace judgment or operate beyond staff visibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every participating community receives a <strong>custom summary report</strong> that reflects what was learned,
    highlights key pressure points, and outlines practical options for improvement. Communities keep this
    report whether or not they choose to move forward.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight highlight-green">
    Comparable reviews and workflow assessments are typically procured as paid consulting engagements,
    often budgeted in the <strong>mid five-figure range</strong>. As part of this pilot, the full review
    and summary report are provided at no cost to participating communities.

  <h2>Key Terms (Plain Language)</h2>
  <dl class="definitions">
    <dt>VAULT</dt>
    <dd>
      PublicLogic’s governance framework. It defines authority, ownership, sequencing, and documentation requirements so municipal work stays clear, defensible, and sustainable under pressure, turnover, and audit.
    </dd>
    <dt>CASE</dt>
    <dd>
      A structured workspace for a specific piece of municipal work. Each CASE has a clear owner, visible status, required documentation, and a defined closeout point aligned with public records and retention requirements.
    </dd>
    <dt>Kismet</dt>
    <dd>
      The law-embedded artifacts and automation produced during the pilot to live inside each CASE. These are town-owned, cataloged tools, forms, templates, and automated steps that operate inside your workspace, remain usable without vendor lock-in, and can be maintained and improved over time.

  <h2>What Changes for Staff</h2>
  <p>
    After a workflow is restructured through the pilot, staff no longer need to decide on the fly
    whether something "counts," who owns it, or whether silence represents approval or risk.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    Those questions are answered by design. Staff can focus on the substance of the work
    instead of carrying the administrative uncertainty around it.
  </div>
  <div class="highlight highlight-green">
    <strong>Empowering Diverse Contributors:</strong> Clear structure reduces the "Wild West" nature of municipal work, making roles accessible to seniors, volunteers, and people with disabilities. Staff can rely on defined processes rather than personal memory—improving retention, equity, and continuity.

  <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
  <p>
    Institutional memory is thinning due to retirements and turnover. Compliance expectations continue
    to grow. New tools are being introduced faster than underlying processes can absorb them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This pilot exists to help towns <strong>put structure in place first</strong>, so improvements
    are sustainable rather than fragile.
  </p>

  <div class="next-steps">
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      The pilot is free. There is no obligation to proceed beyond the initial review.
    </p>
    <div class="action">
      <strong>First step:</strong>
      A 45-minute conversation to identify one or two workflows to review and confirm fit.
    </div>
    <p class="commitment">
      <strong>What we ask from the town:</strong> Staff availability for conversations and access to
      existing process materials. Nothing more unless you choose to move forward.
